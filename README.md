## Running the project
### Docker:
* Install docker
* Open "docker-compose.yml" file and put your API Key and Secret under the environment section of "jupyter"
* Run "docker-compose up" in the command line
* Watch the jupyter logs and look a line that includes ":8888/?token=XXXXX"
* Open the browser and go to "localhost:8888/?token=XXXX"
* In a separate tab you can "localhost:7474" which is the Neo4j browser
